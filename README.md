# <span style="color:lightblue" target="_blank"> [Portfolio Site](https://Zynorthis.github.io)

My personal software development portfolio website. The website was created with the challenge of using HTML and CSS only in mind. No JavaScript, JQuery or any technologies that incorperate them such as bootstrap. CSS grid along with added technologies such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) were used to give the site a very responsive design.
